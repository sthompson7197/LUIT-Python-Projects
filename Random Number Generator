#Random Number Generator
#This generator asks the user to input a number. The program will respond if the inputted number is higher or lower than the random integer.

import random

#number is equal to a random generated number between 0 and 100
number = random.choice(range(0, 100))


#user inputs a number
guess = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

#loops through code while number is not equal to guess.
while number != guess:
  if number > guess:
    print("Your guess is lower than the random integer.")
  elif number < guess:
    print("Your guess is higher than the random integer.")

#asks user to input a new number if condition is still true.
  guess = int(input("Please enter a new number: "))

if guess == number:
  print("You have guessed the correct number!")
